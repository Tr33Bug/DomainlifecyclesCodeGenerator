# DomainlifecyclesCodeGenerator

<!-- The DCG Demo App is an application which is a frontend and server for the showcasing of the Domainlifecycles Code Generator (DCG) model which was developed as part of my master thesis at esentri. 
This repository is a decoupling from the main repository [DomainlifecyclesCodeGenerator](https://github.com/Tr33Bug/DomainlifecyclesCodeGenerator) in which the entire development of the model is documented.  -->

## Overview
<!-- This repository contains a basic PyQT app with a flask server to run the fine-tuned DCG model, showcasing the code generation.
